This is a homework assignment framework for an Augmented Reality paint splatter
ball game prototype for __CIS568-Game Design Practicum__ at University of Pennsylvania.
The framework is created by Ruoyu Fan.
 (Ruoyu also drew the sheep! If it is not good as a AR target just switch to another 
 or your own at ImageTarget settings)
